# Call-Routing-System

Every mobile phone is connected to the nearest base station/cell-phone tower.At any point of time, a mobile phone is connected to only one base station. Whenever a mobile phone moves from the area of one base station to another base station, it will be disconnected from its original base station and connected to the new base station which is nearest to its live location. When a phone call is made from phone p 1 connected with base station b 1 to a phone p 2 , the first thing that the base station b 1 has to do is to find the base station with which p 2 is connected. For that, b 1 sends a query to a central server C which maintains a data structure that can answer the query and return the name of the base station, letâ€™s call it b 2 , with which p 2 is connected. Cis the root node of this hierarchical structure that sends some routing information to b 1 so that b 1 can initiate a call with b 2 and, through the base stations p 1 and p 2 can talk.
